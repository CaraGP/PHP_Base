Todo list app
Stage 1
 Don't care about:
    - separating templates and code
    - OOP
    - just make it work

 To do:
    - homepage has list of todos (deadline - date, title, description, person responsible)
    - there is a simple form on homepage (or separate page) to add new todo
    - there's option to edit the todo
    - there's option to delete todo

Stage 2
    - add composer (to learn package dependancy)
    - add doctrine
    - add templating engine

Stage 3
    - replace with Symfony
